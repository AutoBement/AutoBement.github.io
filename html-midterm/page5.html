    <h3 id="#Page1">Page 1 Errors</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Line 2: The language was missing. To fix this, I added lan="en" to the preexisting html.</li>
            <li>Line 4: The meta charset was missing so I added it in.</li>
            <li>Line 24: "Item 3" was missing the closing list tag. Therefore, I added the closting list tag in. </li>
            <li>Line 27: the image was not being displayed because it was not being accessed correctly. To fix this, I added in ../html-midterm/img/. This clarifies which folder the image is located in.</li>
            <li>Line 32: The table tag was missing the closing tag, so I added it in.</li>
            <li>Line 36: "Cell 3" was missing the closing tr tag, so I added it in. </li>
            <li>Line 38: The tr tag was missing its closing tag, so I added it in. </li>
        </ul>
    <h3 id="Page2">Page 2 Errors</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Line 25: "New Beehive Inn" was supposed to be in bold, however the tag wasn't closed propperly, it was missing the /b. So I added it back in.</li>
        <li>Line 41: The link wasn't the correct link, so i replaced it with the actual link from the wiki page.</li>
        <li>Line 53: The bold tags around h3 cannot be incased in a bold tag (b) because the header is automatically bolded. To fix this, I removed the bold tag.</li>
        <li>Line 57: The link  wasn't an actual link, so I replaced it with the actual link from the Wiki page.</li>
        <li>Line 76: the h6 tag was missing the closing tag, so I added it in. </li>
        <li>The header scale was thrown off. To fix this, I changed the h3 and h6 tags to h2 tags</li>
        
    </ul>
    <h3 id="Page3">Page 3 Errors</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Line 1: The document type was not being defined. So I added !DOCTYPE infront of the already existing html.</li>

        <li>Line 3: Inside the 'head' tag, the code was missing the title and meta information as well as a link to the CSS stylesheet. Therefore, I added that information in.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="Page4">Page 4 Errors</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Line 1: The documnet type was not being defined. So I added !DOCTYPE infront of the already existing html.</li>
        <li>Line 36: td was missing its closing tag. To fix this, I added it in.</li>
        <li>Line 41: Image was missing the tr tags around it so i added them in.</li>
        <li>Line 46: The code had a closing tr tag but was missing the opening tag so I added it in.</li>
        <li>With the way the table was set up, the images were not correlating with the label. To fix this, I moved the titles from the columns into their respective rows. </li>
        <li>Every picture was missing an image discription so I added one in for each photo.</li>
    </ul>
